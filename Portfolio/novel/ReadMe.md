# Horror Novel Generator

This updated novel generator takes in the full story from three horror novels, generates example texts from all of them, and then generates a full novel called "Pure Horror" in a directory entitled "Abominations". The stories are all in first-person and are mixed together to almost comedic effect.

## Update: Fixed Encoding for At the Mountains of Madness

The text file for the H.P. Lovecraft novel is now opened with surrogate permissions that fixes the encoding issues preventing us from using it in the final novel.

## Update: Added Chapters

Chapters of random lengths have been added to the story in order to make it feel more purposeful.

## Update: Fixed Indentation

The tab character when converting the story to PDF format was only one space long. We replace them with five spaces to make the paragraphs look better in the final story.
