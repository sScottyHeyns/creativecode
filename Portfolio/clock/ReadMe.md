# Color Clock

This clock represents time through color and a visual representation. The imagery is meant to invoke the way time used to be told: through the speed of photons. The second ball travels at 2 cycles a second, the minute hand runs one-sixtieth as slow, and the hour hand runs one-sixtieth slower than that. The program takes in the initial clock parameters in order to start the balls where they need to be.

## Updated: Color Palette

The color palette of this project has been refined to be gentler on the eyes. The colors shown are part of a "Retro Gaming" color palette, reminiscent of the limited palette of old 8-bit games.

## Updated: Time Function

Instead of using the millisecond function of P5JS we use the "frameCount" function to keep track of time at 60 frames per second. This should help keep the time tracking consistent with the visuals.
