
Macbeth
   King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman
And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
Come like shadowes, so depart.
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
But I must also feele it as a man;
That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
The Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,
Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,
Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
Enter Hecat, and the other three Witches.
As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,
Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,

Macbeth
How you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,
For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,
Is this a Dagger, which I see before me,
It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre.
Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night
Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,
Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
Are with a most indissoluble tye
That euery minute of his being, thrusts
Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury

Macbeth
On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
Or not those in Commission yet return'd?
Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,
Know, that it was he, in the times past,
Your Charmes, and euery thing beside;
And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne,
Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand,
   King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman
And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast

Macbeth
The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?
To Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,
Rebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood
   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?
Of many Kings. If there come truth from them,
Are with a most indissoluble tye
Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
Are with a most indissoluble tye
Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
Or memorize another Golgotha,
And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.
Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury

Macbeth
Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,
Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,
And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,
By his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath
   Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?
Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
Vpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,
Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.

Macbeth
In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,
The fit is momentary, vpon a thought
  Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord
Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returne
Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.
Though Castles topple on their Warders heads:
(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,
And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know

Macbeth
Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,
Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt
On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,
By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth
Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,
Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
I cannot but remember such things were
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;

Macbeth
Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,
And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
Thou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
Confounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,
How easie is it then? your Constancie
Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe,
And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
Contending 'gainst Obedience, as they would

Macbeth
   Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit
The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,
For strangers to my Nature. I am yet
It is concluded: Banquo, thy Soules flight,
Of Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth
Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.
Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes.
Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,
Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,
And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare

Macbeth
Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt
   Banquo within. Giue vs a Light there, hoa
   Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit
And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce
Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,
Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,
In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Ile catch it ere it come to ground;

Macbeth
To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,
of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne
In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
Sirrha, a word with you: Attend those men
And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch
At what it did so freely? From this time,
With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,
Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;

Macbeth
Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.
Th' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:
Come like shadowes, so depart.
And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
That euery minute of his being, thrusts
When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you
That palter with vs in a double sence,
These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
