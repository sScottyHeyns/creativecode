# Poem Project: Changes

This project has been changed to take non-poetic works and turn them into poetry, instead of rearranging existing poetry. The Sonnet Crafter takes in a list of text files containing plays, preferably Shakespearean, and turns them into sonnets. The definition of a sonnet in this instance is a twelve line poem that has only 10 syllables per line. This constitutes a semi-Shakespearean sonnet, since the lines don't follow the line schemes.

## Examples

Included are examples in which I take lines from Much Ado About Nothing and Macbeth and turn them into 12 different sonnets in a new file.
