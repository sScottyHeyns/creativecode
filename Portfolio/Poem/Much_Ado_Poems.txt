The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish
As best befits her wounded reputation, 
I may avoid him. Which of these is he?
Hearken after their offence, my lord.
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
she,  a fine little one.’  No,’ said I,
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill’d
And she is dead, slander’d to death by villains,
Thus answer I in name of Benedick,
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
the church bench till two, and then all to bed.
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,

Much_Ado
As we do trace this alley up and down,
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
And she is dead, slander’d to death by villains,
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming;
But on this travail look for greater birth.
Tush! fear not, man, we’ll tip thy horns with gold,
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
Than this for whom we rend’red up this woe!
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
But on this travail look for greater birth.

Much_Ado
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
Whisper her ear, and tell her, I and Ursala
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
Friendship is constant in all other things
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch

Much_Ado
One Hero died defil’d, but I do live,
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
O! one too much by thee. Why had I one?
Come, bid me do anything for thee.
Is all of her; say that thou overheard’st us,
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill’d
Which is the lady I must seize upon?
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
But on this travail look for greater birth.
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.

Much_Ado
Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
Is that she will not add to her damnation
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio:
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
O! very well, my lord: the music ended,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
And by that fatherly and kindly power
Goes foremost in report through Italy.
Good morrow, masters: put your torches out.

Much_Ado
Can cunning sin cover itself withal.
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
O! good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency
We’ll fit the kid-fox with a penny-worth.
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
But on this travail look for greater birth.
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
That which appears in proper nakedness?
I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death:
In practice let us put it presently.

Much_Ado
indeed, for I love thee against my will.
I am out of all other tune, methinks.
[Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio and Leonato.]
Upon the error that you heard debated:
helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
Than when she liv’d indeed: then shall he mourn, 
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
When I do name him, let it be thy part
Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
Values itself so highly, that to her
Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
Content yourself. God knows I lov’d my niece;

Much_Ado
Than when she liv’d indeed: then shall he mourn, 
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
Good morrow, masters: put your torches out.
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
said I,  the gentleman is wise.’  Certain,’
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
What kind of catechizing call you this?
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this

Much_Ado
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio:
To stain my cousin with. One doth not know
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
In the rare semblance that I lov’d it first.
Which I will do with confirm’d countenance.
Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
Confirm’d, confirm’d! O! that is stronger made,
But on this travail look for greater birth.

Much_Ado
For my part, I am so attir’d in wonder,
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
Shall be lamented, pitied and excus’d
Hath any man seen him at the barber’s?
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
And when I have heard it, what blessings brings it?
no intent to turn husband, have you?
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
No, though he thought his accusation true.
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming;
May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin’d
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch

Much_Ado
Enter Dogberry, Verges,  and the Watch, with
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
If it prove so, then loving goes by haps:
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Until tomorrow morning, lords, farewell.
lute-string, and now governed by stops.
Dapples the drowsy East with spots of grey.
Thus answer I in name of Benedick,
The fairest grant is the necessity.
And she is dead, slander’d to death by villains,
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,

Much_Ado
That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand
The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
Than this for whom we rend’red up this woe!
Which is the villain? Let me see his eyes,
That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand
We have some haste, Leonato.
    Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
Enter Dogberry, Verges,  and the Watch, with
No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
