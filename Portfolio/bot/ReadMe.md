# Random D&D Character Generator

This Twitter bot uses JavaScript code prepared in Cheap Bots Done Quick to tweet unique and fun D&D characters every hour of the day! Scroll through the pages of this bot's tweets and find inspiration for your next player character. The current model includes all races (with their subraces) and classes (with subclasses) under 5th Edition D&D and its expansions.

## Find the Tweets

This twitter bot's homepage is: https://twitter.com/InTheTavernYou1

Changes were made around midnight 12/13/2019, so that is when the changes in the bot's code can be observed. Since then it tweets a character every ten minutes, so it should run through a bunch of different charracters by the time it is observed for this project.

## Update: Preambles

In addition to creating unique characters this bot now provides flavor text that goes at the beginning of the tweet, giving personality to the creation. 

## Update: Fixed Ridiculous Ages

Ages beyond the normal lifespan are now much more rare. There is now only a 12% chance that the bot will choose an age for the character that is outside the normal lifespan of a human. Originally I though that there should be a better chance of the 100-300 year range than the 300-1000 year range because dwarves live around that long, but this just led to a lot of characters being way past their races' prime (Humans, Orcs, Halflings, etc.). So now only 12 out of every 100 characters will have an age over 85.
