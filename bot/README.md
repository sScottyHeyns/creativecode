# Bot Project

This bot, [@InATavernYou1](https://twitter.com/inatavernyou1), is designed to help you come up with your next D&D character through random permutation. The idea is to spark your imagination and help you think of an intersting character. Does the bot tell you to play a 155 year old human? Then you'd better justify how that human has lived so long. It's a fun and interesting thought experiment that will surely spice up your next campaign!
With 57 unique race-subrace combinations, 70 different class-subclass variations, and ages ranging from 17-1000 years old, this bot has about 3.93 million different permutations tweeting out about once every hour.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
