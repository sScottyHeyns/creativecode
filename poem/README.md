# Sonnet Shaker

  This program is a study in the meaning of Shakespeare's Sonnets, and sonnets in general, through the ordering of their lines. Observe as this program takes a random pair of rhyming lines from the main body of the poem and exchanges it with the rhyming couplet as the end. This changes the final beat of the poem, which usually tells us as the reader what idea to focus on. Swapping these lines out changes the perspective and gives the sonnet an entirely new feel. This will work with any of Shakespeare's Sonnets, provided they follow the usual 14 line structure with a ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme. If you do experiment with other sonnets, make sure the text file ends in a new line.
